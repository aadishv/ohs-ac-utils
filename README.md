# remaining stuff to get AI working

- [X] also port all current indexedDB stuff to Dexie
- [X] indexedDB/localStorage caching...? at least have the fetcher hit a per-session cache perhaps
- [X] tool for frame fetching (option to show to user)
- [ ] update system prompt with tools
  * key thing -- if you wanna see the result, end your turn and the user will show you the frame
- [ ] add guide for getting API key
- [ ] citations API perhaps? not sure how useful for giant blocks of text, maybe use a "cite string"
- [ ] reimplement downloading (see popup/main.tsx:54)
